## Folding Table
Work table with collapse-able legs. Light weight and reasonable size for various assembly and light construction projects.

Straightforward 1x construction with 1/2" ply top.  Makes a lightweight and sturdy table that's not too difficult to carry.  The legs fold under the top for storage.  

Assembly using glue + screws worked quite well.
